Machine Learning Model Evaluation Metrics
This repository explores key evaluation metrics for both classification and regression machine learning models. It provides hands-on examples and implementations to demonstrate how these metrics are calculated and interpreted, highlighting their importance in assessing model performance, especially in scenarios like imbalanced datasets or the presence of outliers.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main components:

metrics.py: Contains custom implementations of various evaluation metrics for both classification (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) and regression (e.g., MSE, RMSE, MAE).
classification.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook focusing on classification metrics. It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to train a classifier and evaluates its performance using the implemented metrics, discussing challenges like imbalanced datasets.
regression.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook dedicated to regression metrics. It utilizes the California Housing dataset to train a linear regression model and analyzes its performance with the implemented metrics, addressing considerations like the impact of outliers.
questions.pdf: A document providing definitions and explanations of the various evaluation metrics covered in this project.
Key Learnings
Understanding Classification Metrics: Delve into Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, and understand their individual strengths and weaknesses, particularly in the context of imbalanced datasets.
Understanding Regression Metrics: Explore Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and learn how to interpret them in regression tasks, including identifying the presence of outliers.
Practical Implementation: See how these metrics are implemented from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of their underlying calculations.
Model Assessment: Learn to effectively assess the quality of machine learning models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Addressing Challenges: Gain insights into common challenges in model evaluation, such as misleading accuracy in imbalanced classification or the impact of outliers in regression.
